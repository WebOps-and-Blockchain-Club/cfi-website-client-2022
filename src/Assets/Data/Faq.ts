    question: "How do I ##propose a good idea?",
    answer:
      "Think of the ideal combination of problem-solution fits, the latest technology, and feasibility, and you have an idea that would work well in the Student Innovation Program!<br/>Always start by identifying a problem. Do not propose solutions without discussing the problem in depth with project mentors.",

  },
  {
    question: "How do I ##contact the club heads?",
    answer:
      "Look at https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/contact-us - you may email, message or call the club heads to get started. Please also be sensitive to the fact that they're also students just like you - they're pretty busy - so be patient and don't give up if you don't receive a response immediately",
  },
  {
    question: "So my project got selected. How do I ##get started?",
    answer:
      "Once the project is selected and you've successfully completed your tasks, you'll be guided by the club to select project members appropriately suited to the task at hand. You'll have to budget the amount you require to work with and train your team for the required skills before you start in earnest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why ##isn't my idea selected?",
    answer:
      "You can always approach the club heads and you'll get to know what the reasoning was. Sometimes, it is due to lack of feasibility, at other times, because it's already been done, and sometimes, because we can only do so many projects at a time. It could even be something else entirely, but don't worry, all is not lost.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I do if my ##project is not selected?",
    answer:
      "It is far more honorable to deliver and execute a given idea than to come up with ideas, there's far more merit in a complete project that does a simple thing well than a proposal for a complex thing that may never see the light of day. As a project member or coordinator, you can always influence the direction a project is going, don't let a small hurdle stand in your way of ideating and creating an amazing project. At worst, you'll learn a new skill, at best, you can deliver a project that you can influence and mould in your own way.",

  {
    question: "How do I make a ##submission on the portal?",
    answer: "",

  },
  {
    question: "Deadline for ##final project idea submission",
    answer: "24th April.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I ##make sure my idea gets selected?",
    answer:
      "Short answer: you can't because there's really no guaranteed way. Long answer: talk to the appropriate club heads and approach them slowly but surely. Mould your idea using their experience and insights into something that is better. Be open minded about what's really feasible, what's really useful and how you can achieve it. Don't fixate on an idea. Try to ideate to change people's lives. Try to save the environment. Try to make the world a better place. The list is literally endless, but don't do things just because they're cool. Do them because they mean something to you and to the world. And even then, it's not guaranteed, but at worst, you'll be a better person for the time you spend doing it. A slightly better problem solver. A slightly better scientist. A slightly better engineer. That's what you're here for, aren't you?",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I propose this as an ##individual or as a team?",
    answer:
      "Both are just fine. If you propose this as an individual, we'll find you a team like we discussed above. If you have a team that you work well with, we'll be more than happy to help you retain that team. Just make sure you'll be able to work well with them and aren't going to end up as a bunch of friends who had a great idea but ended up confusing work for recreation. Is this meant to be fun? Absolutely. But this is the kind of fun that puts you in a slightly difficult situation to make it interesting. Not the same ol same ol jokes and banter. Individuals are also to be careful of this ;)",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Ok this sounds cool and all but I don't think I even have the ##skills to do this",
    answer:
      "No, trust me, the one thing  this requires is no prior technical knowledge. Anyone can identify a problem that needs solving. Anyone can work on a problem and ideate possible solutions using a big picture approach without concerning oneself with the technical details. All you have to do is try your best without expecting anything out of it.",
