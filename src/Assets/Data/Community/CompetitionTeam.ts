    )} student team of 70+ from IIT Madras focused on revolutionising transportation with sustainable Hyperloop technologies - backed by the Indian Government! Last July, we developed our latest pod which had upgrades such as contactless propulsion with improved efficiency, contactless braking, and was designed for a custom track that supports levitation. We also finished in the global top-5 at European Hyperloop Week (EHW) 2022, bagging nominations in Traction systems, Electrical systems, and the Complete Pod category.`,

This Vacuum tube is expected to be fully built and functional by mid 2023. Once fully functional, this facility will be the world’s largest Hyperloop testing facility that is run by a student team. This facility will act as a sub-scale testing ground for Hyperloop, and will be the hub for Hyperloop in India - initiating conferences, competitions and accelerated research and testing. Since infrastructure takes upto 70% of the total cost of Hyperloop system, our patented tube design is a prime example of frugality of innovation. The team has set up a 3.6m long vacuum tube prototype at the CFI workspace to test the validity of the design and the compatibility of various components of the pod, and has successfully tested the vacuum holding capabilities of the design - which now serves as the green signal for our upcoming project.",
