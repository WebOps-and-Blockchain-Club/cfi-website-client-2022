It has succeeded in sending teams to competitions like URC, ROBOCON, DRDO, IARC, IAUVC and FIRA. <br /> By offering indispensable guidance through workshops and tutorials along with equipment to all the interested students, iBot club helps students express their skills, knowledge and creativity through conceptualising and designing state of the art prototypes. iBot club is not leaving any stone unturned in the process of becoming a self-sustained student robotics hub. <br /> The iBot Club is home to many of Insti’s robotics enthusiasts who spend a great chunk of their time designing and prototyping robots which can perform any required task. It organises regular workshops to inspire students across varied technical backgrounds to develop their ideas and expose them to the wonders of robotics.",

      "The Biotech Club, born in 2023 as a vertical under iGEM, is a group of passionate individuals determined to showcase the wonders of biotech to the student community. Our vision is to create an inclusive interdisciplinary haven where students can explore exciting ideas and endless possibilities in biotechnology. The club organizes a series of captivating events and engaging workshops to stimulate your brain, facing those ideas that keep you up at night (zombie apocalypse, anyone?). Apart from this, the club undertakes student projects in biotechnology. At the Biotech Club, the only prerequisite is a deep-seated desire to dive into biotechnology. The club offers a haven for anyone looking to get their hands dirty, ideate and dig deep to come up with solutions.<br /> <b>Together we’ll turn dreams into reality, one DNA strand at a time!</b>",
