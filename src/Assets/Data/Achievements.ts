      "GOGEC-2021",
      "https://www.gogecconference.org/"
    )}). Their project aims to combat the increasing environmental concerns raised by industrial whey wastewater discharge. They intend to utilize the whey wastestream as their feedstock to produce bacterial cellulose (BC) by engineering different strains of the K.xylinus bacteria to metabolize lactose thus paving the way for the production of BC based hydrogels.<br /><br />The team also presented this idea in two other avenues namely the Synbio Power Pitch conducted by the ${link(

      "https://www.synbio.fi/about-1"
    )} and the National Bioengineering Conference (NBC) organised by NIT Rourkela. They reached the semifinals from among ~30 teams in the Power Pitch and were awarded the Unique Idea Award in NBC 2022.`,

All reports are gathered onto a real-time flood map. The data gathered through this platform aims to improve disaster preparedness and response in communities by gathering, sorting, and presenting data of flooding reports. This Crowd-sourced data, curated through this platform will help to understand the reasons for waterlogging / inundation and help IIT Madras researchers to develop/design remedial measures that may be recommended to GCC, PWD, and other relevant Govt. departments for their action.`,

Team Abhyuday has already set new records by becoming the first-ever rocketry team across IITs to qualify for Spaceport America Cup. In fact, there were very few available competition slots for new teams, but Team Abhyuday made it nevertheless. This has been no small feat, considering the fact that the team was formed during the pandemic, and they had not met in person once prior to the qualification.`,
