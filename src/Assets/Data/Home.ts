                         innovation emerges through community interaction and the freedom to
                         learn and experiment. Constituted in 2008, with the help of funds
                         raised by the class of 1981, this unique 24/7 student lab is located
                         at the New Academic Complex in the heart of campus. After almost a
                         decade of the team's zeal and passion, combined with a comprehensive
                         inventory, ample workspace, guidance from faculty and students, CFI is
                         a house to 14 clubs, 4 competition teams and counting. These clubs'
                         interests are spread over a wide spectrum primarily fostering
                         innovation and invention in technology, with a focus on technologies

                         national recognition. The team frequently represents IIT Madras in
